abstract = "Job performance of employees and stress at work are very common problems in today's business world. Many people change their jobs due to high job stress which affects their personal well-being. High stress can be result of incompatibility between the person performing the job and the job's requirements. This can exacerbate feelings of stress on the job and in an employee's personal life. Whilst employees can be reasonably expected to adjust to changes in jobs over time, poor job or employee job fit can result in increased stress and inefficiency in organizations. To combat this we surmise that through careful attention to person-organization fit during the interview or assessment phase, organizations can select employees who are adaptable to change and who can work efficiently to avoid the negative effects of high stress caused by person job incompatibility. In this study we aimed to examine in detail the effects of person-job fit and the importance of person-organization fit in order to allow organizations to prevent the high cost of employees poorly suited to their jobs. The research indicates that organizations whose employees are suited to their jobs operate with greater efficiency and adapt to change more smoothly than those whose employees do not fit their jobs. The study also aims to investigate if perceived person-organization fit mediates the relationship between person-job fit and job stress. The results of the study demonstrate that paying careful attention to person-job fit and adjusting employees to the organization are essential factors for decreasing job stress."

abstract = "Nowadays, for development employees to achieve new knowledge and technology, culture building and improvement of staff performance, organizations hold different job-training courses. Therefore, measurement training effectiveness and its impact on employee performance has a lot of importance. The present paper aims at determining the impact of on-the-job training courses on the performance of the employees at the Organization for Martyrs‟ Affairs. The statistical population consisted of the managers and staff in 5 provinces; they were selected among those employees who had taken part in at least 2 courses since 2010(N=2700). The witness group (n=480) were selected through “improbable accessible sampling” method based on Morgan, Cohen and Krejcie tables. The data collection was done by the used of valid questionnaire and interviews. The Alpha index (=0.95) was used to measure item reliability. This applied study is done on the basis of descriptive survey method. Data analysis is done through application of both descriptive and interpretative statistics. The findings of the study indicated that these courses affect staff performance to some extent, but the level of changes fall below the desired standard. The study questions found their proper answers and a number of optimization strategies were set forward that can be the area of the further studies. Besides that, we mentioned some recommendations for performance improving of the Foundation's Training department that can be a Basis for next researches."

Therefore user profiling or personalization is one of the major concepts used for accessing the user relevant information, which can be used to solve the difficult problems of recommender system like classification and ranking of items in accordance with an individual's interest. In this paper we focus on the problem of user profiling in which we aim at finding, extracting and integrating keyword based information from various web sources to generate a structured profile. Further we do some experiments on the profiled information to generate knowledge out of it."

abstract = "Sensory science has advanced significantly in the past decade and is quickly evolving to become a key tool for predicting food product success in the marketplace. Increasingly, sensory data techniques are moving towards more dynamic aspects of sensory perception, taking account of the various stages of user-product interactions. Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.
Industrial relevance
The need for sensory evaluation within the food industry is becoming increasingly complex as companies continuously compete for consumer product acceptance in today's highly innovative and global food environment. Recent technological developments in virtual and augmented reality offer the food industry new opportunities for generating more reliable insights into consumer sensory perceptions of food and beverages, contributing to the design and development of new products with optimised consumer benefits. These technologies also hold significant potential for improving the predictive validity of newly launched products within the marketplace."

Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7{\%} of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120{\%}) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300{\%}) can operate at full frame rate.",

abstract="The importance of contextual information has been recognized by researchers and practitioners in many disciplines, including e-commerce personalization, information retrieval, ubiquitous and mobile computing, data mining, marketing, and management. While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, most existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other people (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). In this chapter we argue that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. Furthermore, we introduce three different algorithmic paradigms -- contextual prefiltering, post-filtering, and modeling -- for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, discuss the possibilities of combining several contextaware recommendation techniques into a single unifying approach, and provide a case study of one such combined approach. Finally, we present additional capabilities for context-aware recommenders and discuss important and promising directions for future research.",
